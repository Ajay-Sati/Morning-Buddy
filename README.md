### Morning Buddy – Your One-Stop Morning Assistant
Morning Buddy is an intelligent morning companion designed to simplify your daily routine by bringing together weather updates, top news summaries, and a personalized city itinerary — all in one place. The application collects real-time information every morning and transforms it into simple, actionable insights that help you start your day with clarity and convenience.

#### Smart Weather Insights
Every morning, Morning Buddy fetches the real-time temperature and weather conditions for your location. It analyzes the day’s forecast and provides helpful suggestions on what you should carry, such as an umbrella, jacket, sunscreen, or water bottle, depending on the expected conditions. Instead of checking multiple sources or guessing the weather, the app gives you a quick, reliable summary tailored to your day.

#### Top News Summary for the Day
The application also keeps you informed by scanning the web for the most relevant and trending news as per your preferences and choices. It automatically identifies the top five stories of the day and summarizes them in a clear and concise format. Each summary includes a direct link to the original article, allowing you to dive deeper into any story you find important. Morning Buddy ensures you stay updated without spending time browsing news websites.

#### Personalized City Events & Itinerary Planner
Morning Buddy offers an additional feature where it gathers information about events happening in the city you specify. It explores tourist destinations, activities, shows, and places worth visiting. Based on everything it finds, the app creates a complete day-wise itinerary curated especially for you. The itinerary may include event timings, suggested routes, restaurants, and direct booking links for shows or entry tickets. This makes it an ideal companion for planning outings, weekend plans, or exploring a new city.

#### A Complete Morning Solution
By combining weather insights, news updates, and personalized day plans, Morning Buddy serves as a one-shot solution for all your morning tasks. It eliminates the need to switch between apps and websites, giving you a seamless and organized start to your day. Whether you want to know what to wear, what’s happening around the world, or what to do in your city, the application delivers everything in one clean experience.
